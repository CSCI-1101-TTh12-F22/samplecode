# Sample Code
The repo contains sample code, week by week, for CS1.

To download a particular `.py`, `.txt`, or `.csv` file, do the following.

1. Click on the filename to open it in your browser.
2. **Click where it says `Raw` in the upper left corner.** This will open the file as a plain text file rather than a webpage./
3. Go up to the `File` menu in your browser, and select `Save as` or something along those lines.
4. Save the file to your machine, **making sure to add the correct file extension if it is not displayed (`.py`, `.txt`, or `.csv`).
