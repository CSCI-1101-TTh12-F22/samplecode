## REMEMBER: If you get stuck in an infinite loop,
## hold down the control key and type c. 


# this will go on forever because i will always be less than 10
i = 0
while i < 10:
    print(i)

# this will go on forever because i will never exactly equal 10
i = 1
while i != 10:
    print(i)
    i = i + 2
